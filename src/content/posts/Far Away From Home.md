Far Away From Home

I'm loving living every single day but sometimes I feel so
I hope to find a little piece of mind and I just want to know.

And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.
Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.

In my Dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I 'll be so far away from home.

If we could make it thrue the darkest Night we'd have a brighter day.
The world I see beyond your pretty eyes, makes me want to stay.
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.
Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.

In my Dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I 'll be so far away from home

I count on you, no matter what they say, cause love can find it's time.
I hope to be a part of you again, baby let us shine.

And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.
Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.
In my Dreams I'm not so far away from home

What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I 'll be so far away from home
In my Dreams I'm not so far away from home

Without you I 'll be so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I 'll be so far away from home


天涯羁旅
日升月落，欢歌未歇，心底偶起微澜。
欲寻片刻安宁，聊慰此身孤单。
谁怜寸心，玲珑碎裂？
浮世茫茫，吾辈何安？
遥望银汉，家在何方？
青衫湿遍，复又拭干。
唯有梦魂，不辞遥远，夜夜归故里。
奈何此身，孤悬尘世，孑然立天地。
平生飘泊，四时羁旅，终是异乡客。
若失却君，纵在眼前，亦如隔天涯。
愿与君携手，共渡长夜，必见晨光熹微。
君之星眸，藏我天地，足以慰我风尘。
纵有千言，唯信君故，此情可待时间。
愿化流光，映君之侧，共此一世璀璨。
