# Far Away From Home

## English Lyrics

### Verse 1
I'm loving living every single day but sometimes I feel so
I hope to find a little piece of mind and I just want to know.

### Pre-Chorus
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.
Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.

### Chorus
In my Dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I 'll be so far away from home.

***

### Verse 2
If we could make it thrue the darkest Night we'd have a brighter day.
The world I see beyond your pretty eyes, makes me want to stay.

### Pre-Chorus
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.
Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.

### Chorus
In my Dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I 'll be so far away from home

***

### Bridge
I count on you, no matter what they say, cause love can find it's time.
I hope to be a part of you again, baby let us shine.

### Pre-Chorus
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.
Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.

***

### Outro / Extended Chorus
In my Dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I 'll be so far away from home
In my Dreams I'm not so far away from home

Without you I 'll be so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
Without you I 'll be so far away from home

# 天涯羁旅 (Journeys at the Edge of the World)

### 游子心绪 (The Traveler's Mood)
日升月落，欢歌未歇，心底偶起微澜。
欲寻片刻安宁，聊慰此身孤单。

### 迷惘追问 (Doubt and Inquiry)
谁怜寸心，玲珑碎裂？
浮世茫茫，吾辈何安？
遥望银汉，家在何方？
青衫湿遍，复又拭干。

### 梦境与现实 (Dreams and Reality)
唯有梦魂，不辞遥远，夜夜归故里。
奈何此身，孤悬尘世，孑然立天地。
平生飘泊，四时羁旅，终是异乡客。
若失却君，纵在眼前，亦如隔天涯。

### 希望与承诺 (Hope and Promise)
愿与君携手，共渡长夜，必见晨光熹微。
君之星眸，藏我天地，足以慰我风尘。

### 坚守与期盼 (Steadfastness and Aspiration)
纵有千言，唯信君故，此情可待时间。
愿化流光，映君之侧，共此一世璀璨。
